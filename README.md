virtualenv-creator
==================

If you requirements contain a lot of modules or modules which take a long time to build this little script might help you.
It can create *wheel* files for you requirements on the first setup and reuses them in future virtualenv setups.

Currently it requires files to be named *requirements.txt* and *requirements-dev.txt*

More and better doc and tests will come soon!
